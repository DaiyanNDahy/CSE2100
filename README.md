# CSE2100
This program is developed for the project CSE 21000 or Software Development Project I for my university. Here I developed a system for managing the students affair of a university hall. At the first, the login page is prompted. Only, the provost is allowed to login. The provost can manage all the other affairs after login. The provost can add rooms, activates or deactivate them, allot students to the active & unbooked rooms. When a new student comes,the room is booked. If there is no unbooked room, it shows that all the rooms are booked. When all the rooms are booked or inactive, nobody can be given a room. Students data except the Roll No(which is treated as the primary key). can be updated through the system. For the new month, when the payment is done, the payment date for the specific roll can be upoloaded to the system. If the student has already paid(i.e., his payment for the specific month is already recorded) then, it's impossible record another payment for him. All the data of all the living students can also be found together in this program,too.
